  <h2>Is French spoken in the world?</h2>
  <p>
    There are many countries whose people and languages make their part as the richness in diversity of our world.
    Obviously, the French language plays a big role in that diversity. French is the 22nd natively most spoken language in the 
    world and occupies the 6th place as the most spoken by total number of speakers. Many of those countries
    have been recognized by the Organisation Internationale de la Francophonie, celebrating the 
    language and nationalities of such nations. 
    There is a total of 26 countries where French is commonly spoken. In this website, you can see 
    what continents those are and the number of countries in them.
